The plan has been saved at `/Users/lawrencericher/.claude/plans/magical-hugging-naur.md` with Phase 8 documenting how to backport the new Bayesian features to taurinelc whenever you're ready to implement that.

 **Summary of what's saved:**

* The complete template creation plan (Phases 1-7) - all marked as complete
* **Phase 8: Backport Features to taurinelc** - ready for future implementation, including:
  * Table of features to backport (two-prior framework, assurance, type I error, sensitivity, estimand chapter, etc.)
  * Step-by-step implementation guide
  * TMT/MFIS-specific adaptations
  * Estimated effort (~5-8 hours)
