## Summary of Findings

This section summarizes the key findings from the power analysis and interim analysis simulations.

## Note
This chapter will be populated with specific results after running the full simulation pipeline. The structure below shows the expected content.

## Power Analysis Results

### Required Sample Size

Based on the simulation-based power analysis:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Target Power | 90% |
| Point Estimate (N) | [TBD] |
| 95% CI Lower | [TBD] |
| 95% CI Upper | [TBD] |

### Power by Sample Size

[Power curve plot will be inserted here]

### Interpretation

- At N = [X], the trial achieves approximately [Y]% power
- The conservative estimate (upper CI) suggests N = [Z] for robust power
- Accounting for 10-15% attrition, recommend enrolling N = [W]

## Interim Analysis Results

### Stopping Probabilities

Under the assumed treatment effects:

| Outcome | Probability |
|---------|-------------|
| Early efficacy stop | [TBD]% |
| Early futility stop | [TBD]% |
| Continue to max N | [TBD]% |
| Overall success | [TBD]% |

### Expected Sample Size

- **Mean ESS**: [TBD]
- **Median ESS**: [TBD]
- **Reduction vs. fixed design**: [TBD]%

### Stage-wise Analysis

| Interim (N) | Cumulative Stop % | Efficacy | Futility |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|----------|
| 120 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 180 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 240 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 300 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 360 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 420 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |
| 480 | [TBD] | [TBD] | [TBD] |

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation

Based on the analysis, we recommend:

1. **Maximum sample size**: N = [TBD]
2. **Expected enrollment**: N = [TBD] (accounting for expected early stopping)
3. **Budget for**: N = [TBD] (upper CI + attrition buffer)

### Design Features

The recommended trial design includes:

- **Randomization**: 2:1 (Treatment:Control)
- **Interim analyses**: Every 60 participants starting at N = 120
- **Efficacy stopping**: When P(benefit) > 95% for both outcomes
- **Futility stopping**: When P(benefit) < 10% for either outcome

### Statistical Analysis Plan

1. **Primary analysis**: Bayesian bivariate model at final analysis
2. **Interim analyses**: Pre-specified stopping boundaries
3. **Sensitivity analyses**:
   - Alternative prior specifications
   - Per-protocol analysis
   - Subgroup analyses (severity, duration of Long COVID)

## Limitations

### Simulation Assumptions

1. **Treatment effects**: Based on clinical judgment, not prior data
2. **Correlation**: Assumed 0.2 between outcomes
3. **Baseline distributions**: May differ from actual LC population
4. **Dropout**: Not explicitly modeled

### Generalizability

- Results depend on the assumed effect sizes
- Actual power may differ if true effects are smaller/larger
- Sensitivity analyses (next chapter) explore robustness

## Next Steps

1. **Review assumptions**: Clinical team should validate effect size assumptions
2. **Finalize protocol**: Incorporate recommended sample size
3. **DMC planning**: Establish data monitoring committee procedures
4. **Pre-registration**: Register trial with interim analysis plan
